## DynamoDB Basics

- Made of **tables**
- Each tables has a **primary key**
- Each table can have inf. number of rows(items)
- Each item can have **attributes** (columns, but the can be nested)
- Max size of an item is 400KB
- Data types supported:
    - Scalar: String, Number, Binary, Boolean, Null
    - Document Types: List, Map
    - Set Types: String Set, Number Set, Binary Set

## DynamoDB Primary Keys

- Option I: partition key only (HASH), should be uniq
    - Partition key must be unique for each item
    - Partition key must be "diverse" so data will be distributed
- Option II: partition key + sort key, combination should be uniq
    - Data is grouped by partition key
    - Sort key = range key

## DynamoDB Provisioned Throughput

- Table must have a provisioned read and write capacity
- **Read Capacity Units (RCU)**: throughput for reads
- **Write Capacity Units (WCU)**: throughput for writes
- Option to setup auto-scaling of throughput to meet demand
- Throughput can be exceeded temporarily using "burst credits"
- If no burst credits are available, we get a **ProvisionedThroughputException**
- We should use exponential back-off for retries in case get the exception above
- One write capacity unit represents one write per second for an item up to 1KB in size
- If the items are larger than 1KB, more WCU is consumed

- Examples: 
    - 10 objects per second each of 2KB

    ```
    2 * 10 = 20 WCU
    ```

    - 6 objects per second, 4.5 each

    ```
    6 * 5 = 30 WCU (4.5 should be rounded to 5)
    ```

- **Eventually consistent reads**: if we read after a while it is possible to get unexpected data, there is a possibility that the data did not replicate to every node
- **Strongly consistent reads**: if we read data just after the write we get correct data
- By default: DynamoDB uses eventually consistent reads, but *GetItem*, *Query* and *Scan* can provide a **ConsistentRead** parameter to achieve strong consistency
- One read capacity unit represents one strongly consistent read per second, or two eventually consistent reads per second for an item up to 4KB in size
- If the items are larger than 4KB, more RCU is consumed

- Examples:
    - 10 strongly consistent reads per seconds of 4KB each

    ```
    10 * 4KB / 4KB = 10 RCU
    ```

    - 16 eventual consistent reads per second of 12KB records

    ```
    (16 / 2) * (12 / 4) = 24 RCU
    ```

    - 10 strong consistent reads, 6KB each

    ```
    10 * 8KB / 4  = 20 RCU (we have to round up 6KB to 8 KB)
    ```

## DynamoDB Internal Partitions

- Data is divided in partitions
- Partition keys are hashed in order to know in which partition will the data go
- To compute the number of partitions:
    - Capacity: `(TOTAL RCU / 3000) + (TOTAL WCU / 1000)`
    - Size: `(TOTAL SIZE / 10GB)`
    - Total number of partitions: `CEILING(MAX(Capacity, Size))`
- WCU and RCU are spread evenly between partitions!

## DynamoDB Throttling

- If we exceed our RCU or WCU we get **ProvisionedThroughputExceededException**
- Reasons:
    - Hot keys
    - Hot partition
    - Very large items
- Solutions:
    - Exponential back-off
    - Distribute partition keys as much as possible
    - If RCU issue, use DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)

## DynamoDB - API

### Writing Data

- **PutItem** - write data to DynamoDB (create data or full replace data)
    - Consumes WCU
- **UpdateIem** - update data in DynamoDB (partial update of attributes)
    - Possibility to use Atomic Counters and increase them
- **Conditional Writes**:
    - Accept a write/update only if some conditions are met
    - Helps with concurrent access
    - No additional cost

### Deleting Data

- **DeleteItem**
    - Delete an individual row
    - Ability to perform conditional deletes
- **DeleteTable**
    - Deletes the whole table
    - Much quicker deletion than *DeleteItem*

### Batch Writes

- **BatchWriteIem**
    - Up to 25 *PutItem* and/or *DeleteItem* in one call
    - Up to 16MB of data written
    - Up to 400KB or data per item
- Batching allows to save latency by reducing the number of API calls
- Operations are done in parallel by DynamoDB
- It is possible for a batch to fail, we can retry just the failed items

### Reading Data

- **GetItem**
    - Read based on the primary key
    - Primary key = HASH or HASH-RANGE (partition key + sort key)
    - Eventually consistent by default, but has an option to have strong consistency
    - **ProjectionExpression** can be specified to include only certain attributes

- **BatchGetItem**
    - Up to 100 items
    - Up to 16MB data
    - Items are retrieved in parallel
    - Can be combined with projection expressions

- **Query**
    - PartitionKey value (*must be equals ("=") operator*)
    - SortKey value (operators: =, <, <= >, >=, Between, Begin) - optional
    - FilterExpression to further filter the data (this will happen on the client side)
    - Returns up to 1MB of data or number of items specified by the **Limit**
    - Able to do pagination
    - We can query a table, secondary index or global secondary index
    - Efficient way to query DynamoDB!

- **Scan**
    - Scans the entire table and then filter data
    - Returns up to 1MB ot data - we can use pagination to keep reading
    - Consumes lot of RCU
    - Limit impact using **Limit** /  reduce the size of the result in order to reduce costs
    - For faster performance we can use parallel scan
        - Way more RCU!
    - Can we use a combination of *ProjectionExpression + FilterExpression* (no charge to RCU)
    - Inefficient way to read data from DynamoDB!

## DynamoDB Indexes

### Local Secondary Index (LSI)

- Alternate range key for the table, *local to the hash key*
- Up to 5 LSI/table
- The sort key consist of exactly one scalar attribute
- The attribute can be String, Number, Binary
- *LSI must be defined at table creation time!*

### Global Secondary Index (GSI)

- Used to speed up queries on non-key attributes
- GSI = partition key + optional sort key
- This index can be seen as a new "table"
- We can project attributes on the new "table"
    - The partition key and the sort key of the original table are always projected (KEYS_ONLY)
    - We can specify extra attributes to be projected (INCLUDE)
    - We can use all attributes from main table (ALL)
- We must define a RCU/WCU for the index
- *GSI can be created and modified after origin table creation!*

### Throttling

- DynamoDB indexes can cause throttling
    - GSI: **If writes are throttled in case of a GSI, the main table is throttled as well!** This can happen even if the WCU on the main table is just fine
    - LSI: uses the same WCU and RCU on the main table, can not throttle the main table

## DynamoDB Concurrency Model

- Conditional update/delete: ensures the item hasn't change before altering it
- This feature makes DynamoDB an **optimistic locking / concurrent** database

## DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)

- It is a seamless caching mechanism for DynamoDB
- It can be activated without doing any code change on the application which uses the database
- Writes go through DAX to DynamoDB
- Micro second latency for cache reads & queries
- Solves one big problem: **Hot Key problem** (too many requests for the same key)
- By default: 5 min TTL for every item in the cache
- Up to 10 nodes in the cluster
- Multi AZ (3 nodes minimum recommended)
- Security (encryption at rest with KMS, IAM, CloudTrail)

## DynamoDB Streams

- Changes in a DynamoDB table (create, update, delete) are pushed into a stream
- This stream can be read by Lambda or by EC2 instances
- They can react to this changelog by:
    - Doing analytics
    - Create derivate tables/view
    - Insert data in ElasticSearch
    - etc.
- Could implement cross region replication using Streams (nowadays it is a provided feature by DynamoDB)
- Stream have 24 hours of retention (we can not change this)
- We can choose what type of information ends up in stream:
    - KEYS_ONLY - only the key attributes of the modified items are pushed to the stream
    - NEW_IMAGE - the entire item is pushed to the stream after it was modified
    - OLD_IMAGE - the entire item is pushed to the stream before it was modified
    - NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES - the entire item is pushed to the stream
- DynamoDB streams are made of shards, we don't have to provision them
- Records are not retroactively pushed to the stream after enabling it!

### DynamoDB Streams and Lambda

- We need to define an event source mapping to read from the stream
- We need to ensure the Lambda has the appropriate methods
- The Lambda is invoked synchronously

## DynamoDB TTL (Time to Live)

- TTL = item is automatically deleted after an expiry date/time
- TTL  is provided at no extra cost / no additional WCU/RCU used
- TTL is background task operated by DynamoDB
- Helps reduce storage and manage the size of the table over time
- Helps adhere to regulatory norms
- TTL is enabled per row (we define a TTL columns and add a date there)
    - Can be named however we want
    - Should be a number (we should use time to epoch conversion for deletion timestamp)
- DynamoDB deletes expired items within 48 hours (it wont happen right after the item expired)
- Deleted items are deleted from the indexes as well (GSI/LSI)
- Deleted items could be recovered if DynamoDB Streams were enabled

## DynamoDB CLI

- --projection-expression: attributes to retrieve
- --filter-expression: filter results
- General CLI pagination options:
    - Optimization:
        - --page-size: full dataset is still received but each API call will request less data (helps avoid timeouts)
    - Pagination:
        - --max-number: max number of results returned by the CLI. Returns *NextToken*
        - --starting-token: specify the last received *NextToken* to keep reading data from the next page
- CLI Examples:
    - Scan:

    ```
    aws dynamodb scan --table-name blog-posts --projection-expression "post_id, content" --region us-east-2
    ```

    ```
    aws dynamodb scan --table-name blog-posts --projection-expression "post_id, content" --region us-east-2 --filter-expression "post_id = :p" --expression-attribute-values '{ \":p\" : { \"S\" : \"post-2\" }}'
    ```

    ```
    aws dynamodb scan --table-name blog-posts --projection-expression "post_id, content" --region us-east-2 --page-size 10 --max-items 1
    ```

    ```
    aws dynamodb scan --table-name blog-posts --projection-expression "post_id, content" --region us-east-2 --page-size 10 --max-items 1 --starting-token <token>
    ```

## DynamoDB Transactions

- Ability to create/update/delete multiple rows in different tables at the same time
- "All or nothing" type operation
- Write modes: Standard, Transactional
- Read modes: Eventual Consistent, Strong Consistent, Transactional
- For Transactional it consumes 2x the WCU/RCU

## DynamoDB for Store Session State

- It is common for DynamoDB to be used to store session state of a web application
- Same functionality can be achieved with ElastiCache as well, differences:
    - ElastiCache is in-memory, DynamoDB is serverless (automatic scaling)
    - Both are key/value store
- Same functionality can also be achieved with EFS disk storage, differences:
    - EFS must be attached to an EC2 instance, DynamoDB can be accessed via REST calls
    - EFS can not be used with Lambda
- ... EBS & Instance Store disk storage:
    - EBS & Instance store can only be used as local caching, they are not shared
- ... S3:
    - S3 has higher latency, not a great tool for session state storage

## DynamoDB Write Sharding

- In case the partition key is not distributed enough, or we have limited number of partition keys, we can add a random suffix (or computed suffix) to the key to achieve higher distribution
- Example: voting system if we have 2 candidates

## DynamoDB Write Types:

- Concurrent writes:
    - Two users try to update the same record in the same time
    - The last update wins
- Conditional writes
    - A write can only happen if a specific condition is met
    - First write will succeed, second write will fail because the condition wont be met
    - Important: **data is not overridden**
- Atomic writes:
    - INCREASE BY or DECREASE BY writes
- Batch writes:
    - Write an update containing many items at the same time

## DynamoDB - Large Object Patterns

- Max object size is 400KB
- Pattern:
    - Large object is uploaded to S3
    - Metadata is stored in DynamoDB
    - Reader clients reads the metadata which contains the object path and reads the object from the path
- Index objects in S3:
    - Write into S3 bucket -> trigger notification starts a Lambda function -> Lambda updates DynamoDB table

## DynamoDB Operations

- Table cleanup:
    - Option 1: Scan + Delete => very slow, consumes RCU and WCU
    - Option 2: Drop table => fast, cheap, efficient
- Copy table:
    - Option 1: Use AWS DataPipeline (use EMR): takes the table, puts it into S3, puts it back into DynamoDB table (outdated)
    - Option 2: create a back-up, restore it into a new table
    - Option 3: Scan + Write

## DynamoDB Backups

- **On-demand backups**:
    - We can use the DynamoDB on-demand backup capability to create full backups of our tables for long-term retention and archival for regulatory compliance needs
    - The on-demand backup and restore process scales without degrading the performance or availability of the applications
    - We can create backups that are consistent within seconds across thousands of partitions without worrying about schedules or long-running backup processes
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**:
    - Point-in-time recovery helps protect our DynamoDB tables from accidental write or delete operations
    - Has to be enabled by AWS console, CLI, or with DynamoDB API. Provides continuous backups until we explicitly turn it off
    - With point-in-time recovery, we don't have to worry about creating, maintaining, or scheduling on-demand backups
    - With point-in-time recovery, we can restore that table to any point in time during the last 35 days

## DynamoDB Global Tables

- Enable cross-region replication of a DynamoDB table
- Require DynamoDB streams to be enabled in order to work
- Multi-region, reads can happen in each replication
- Data replication is eventually consistent
- Transactional operations provide atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) guarantees only within the region where the write is made originally
- Transactions are not supported across regions in global tables

## S3 Metadata Index

- Write objects to S3 -> write events trigger a Lambda function -> the function writes the object metadata into DynamoDB table
- Use case: API for object metadata:
    - Search by date
    - Total storage used by consumer
    - List all objects with certain attributes
    - Find all objects uploaded within a date range

## DynamoDB Security & Other Features

- Security:
    - VPC Endpoints to access DynamoDB without internet
    - Access fully controlled by IAM
    - Encryption at rest using KMS
    - Encryption in transit using SSL/TLS
- Amazon DMS:
    - Used to migrate data from Mongo, Oracle, MySQL, S3 to DynamoDB
- Local DynamoDB for development
