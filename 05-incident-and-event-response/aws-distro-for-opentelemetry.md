# AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry

- It is a secure, production-ready AWS supported distribution of the open-source project OpenTelemetry
- Provides a single set of APIs, libraries, agents and collector services
- Collects distributed traces and metrics from our apps
- Collects metadata from our AWS resources and services
- Has auto-instrumented agents to collect traces without changing our code
- Traces/metrics can be sent to multiple AWS services and partner solutions
- We can migrate from X-Ray to AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry if we want to standardize with open-source APIs from Telemetry or send traces tro multiple destinations simultaneously
