# AWS Copilot

- AWS Copilot CLI is a tool for developers to build, release, and operate production ready containerized applications on Amazon ECS and AWS Fargate
- Copilot takes best practices, from infrastructure to continuous delivery, and makes them available to customers from the comfort of their command line
- AWS Copilot helps customers focus on building their applications rather than setting up their infrastructure
- AWS Copilot will create other resources on behalf of the user. Aside from ECS clusters, tasks, services (for EC2 and Fargate launch types) these resources include load balancers, VPC, and ECR registries. These resources are configured based on our opinionated best practices by default but can be changed if required
